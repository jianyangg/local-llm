## ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS

## TRIBUTE TO EARLE THOMPSON

```
∑Mr. TUBERVILLE. Mr. President,
every single day, our veterans use the
skills and discipline they learned in
uniform to build up our country.
Countless veterans pass on these les-
sons to others. Colonel Earle Thomp-
son, from Lake Martin, is one such ex-
ample.
Colonel Thompson began his military
service by signing up for the U.S. Army
after graduating from Carroll High
School in Ozark. This was the start of
an accomplished 36-year-military ca-
reer. Earle went on to get his bach-
elor’s degree from the University of
South Alabama. He balanced being a
fulltime student while serving in the
Alabama National Guard. After col-
lege, he transitioned to the Air Force,
where he would serve 28 years across
the globe, including combat sorties in
Panama and Operation Desert Storm.
He took full advantage of the training
we have to offer right here in Alabama,
particularly at Maxwell Air Force
Base. There, he went through Squadron
Officer’s School, Air Command and
Staff College, and Air War College.
Since retirement, Earle has been
doing his part to help students make
the most of Alabama’s resources for
successful careers. For the last 13
years, he has been using his military
experience to lead aviation training at
Auburn University. He serves as the
deputy director for Defense Research
Programs, where he teaches air traffic
control and aerodynamics. His work
helps address the shortage of both com-
mercial and military pilots in the U.S.
Additionally, Earle serves as the
chair of the Auburn University Re-
gional Airport Safety Committee. He is
also actively involved in Opelika First
Baptist Church, where he sings in the
choir. Earle spent 36 years protecting
our Nation, and now, he is raising up
the next generation of pilots who will
help Alabama soar to new heights. It is
my honor to recognize Colonel Earle
Thompson as the March Veteran of the
Month.∑

## REPORT ON THE STATE OF THE

## UNION DELIVERED TO A JOINT

## SESSION OF CONGRESS ON

## MARCH 7, 2024—PM 41

```
The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
fore the Senate the following message
from the President of the United
States which was ordered to lie on the
table:
To the Congress of the United States:
Good evening. Mr. Speaker. Madam
Vice President. Members of Congress.
My Fellow Americans.
In January 1941—President Franklin
Roosevelt came to this chamber to
speak to the Nation. He said—-‘‘I ad-
dress you at a moment unprecedented
```

# March 7, 2024 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S

in the history of the Union’’. Hitler was
on the march. War was raging in Eu-
rope. President Roosevelt’s purpose
was to wake up the Congress and alert
the American people that this was no
ordinary moment. Freedom and democ-
racy were under assault in the world.
Tonight—I come to the same cham-
ber to address the Nation. Now it is we
who face an unprecedented moment in
the history of the Union. And yes—my
purpose tonight is to both wake up this
Congress and alert the American peo-
ple that this is no ordinary moment ei-
ther.
Not since President Lincoln and the
Civil War have freedom and democracy
been under assault here at home as
they are today. What makes our mo-
ment rare is that freedom and democ-
racy are under attack both at home
and overseas at the very same time.
Overseas—Putin of Russia—is on the
march. Invading Ukraine—and sowing
chaos throughout Europe and beyond.
If anybody in this room thinks Putin
will stop at Ukraine—I assure you—he
will not.
But Ukraine can stop Putin—if we
stand with Ukraine. And provide the
weapons it needs to defend itself. That
is all Ukraine is asking. They are not
asking for American soldiers. In fact—
there are no American soldiers at war
in Ukraine. And I am determined to
keep it that way.
But now—assistance for Ukraine is
being blocked by those who want us to
walk away from our leadership in the
world. It wasn’t that long ago when a
Republican President—Ronald
Reagan—thundered—‘‘Mr. Gorbachev—
tear down this wall’’.
Now—my predecessor—a former Re-
publican President—tells Putin—‘‘Do
whatever the hell you want.’’ A former
American President actually said
that—bowing down—to a Russian lead-
er. It’s outrageous. It’s dangerous. It’s
unacceptable.
America is a founding member of
NATO—the military alliance of demo-
cratic nations—created after World
War II to prevent war and keep the
peace.
Today—I’ve made NATO stronger
than ever. We welcomed Finland to the
Alliance last year. And just this morn-
ing—Sweden officially joined NATO—
and their Prime Minister—is here to-
night.
Mr. Prime Minister—welcome to
NATO—the strongest military alliance
the world has ever known.
I say this to Congress—we must
stand up to Putin. Send me the Bipar-
tisan National Security Bill. History is
watching. If the United States walks
away now—it will put Ukraine at risk.
Europe at risk. The free world at risk—
emboldening others who wish to do us
harm.
My message to President Putin is
simple. We will not walk away. We will
not bow down. I will not bow down.
History is watching.
Just like history watched 3 years ago
on January 6th. Insurrectionists

```
stormed this very Capitol and placed a
dagger at the throat of American de-
mocracy. Many of you were here on
that darkest of days. We all saw with
our own eyes these insurrectionists
were not patriots. They had come to
stop the peaceful transfer of power and
to overturn the will of the people.
January 6th—the lies about the 2020
election—and the plots to steal the
election—posed the gravest threat to
our democracy since the Civil War.
But they failed. America stood
strong—and democracy prevailed. But
we must be honest—the threat re-
mains—and democracy must be de-
fended.
My predecessor and some of you
here—seek to bury the truth of Janu-
ary 6th. I will not do that. This is a
moment—to speak the truth and bury
the lies. And here’s the simplest truth.
You can’t love your country—only
when you win.
As I’ve done ever since being elected
to office—I ask you all—without regard
to party—to join together—and defend
our democracy! Remember—your oath
of office—to defend against all
threats—foreign and domestic. Respect
free and fair elections! Restore trust in
our institutions! And make clear—po-
litical violence—has no place in Amer-
ica! History is watching.
And history is watching another as-
sault on freedom. Joining us tonight—
is Latorya Beasley—a social worker
from Birmingham, Alabama. 14 months
ago tonight—she and her husband wel-
comed a baby girl—thanks to the mir-
acle of IVF. She scheduled treatments
to have a second child. But the Ala-
bama Supreme Court shut down IVF
treatments across the State unleashed
by the Supreme Court decision over-
turning Roe v. Wade. She was told her
dream would have to wait. What her
family has gone through should never
have happened. And unless the Con-
gress acts—it could happen again.
So tonight—let’s stand up for fami-
lies like hers! To my friends across the
aisle—don’t keep families waiting any
longer. Guarantee the right to IVF na-
tionwide!
Like most Americans—I believe—Roe
v. Wade got it right. And I thank Vice
President HARRISfor being an incred-
ible leader defending reproductive free-
dom and so much more.
But my predecessor—came to office
determined to see Roe v. Wade over-
turned. He’s the reason it was. In fact—
he brags about it. Look at the chaos.
Joining us tonight is Kate Cox—a
wife and mother from Dallas. When she
became pregnant again the fetus had a
fatal condition. Her doctors told Kate
that her own life—and her ability to
have children in the future—were at
risk. Because Texas law banned abor-
tion Kate and her husband had to leave
the State to get the care she needed.
What her family has gone through
should never have happened as well.
But it is happening to so many oth-
ers. There are State laws banning abor-
tion—criminalizing doctors—and forc-
```
```
ing survivors of rape and incest to
leave their States as well.
Many of you in this chamber—and
my predecessor—are promising to pass
a national ban on reproductive free-
dom. My God—what freedoms will you
take next?
In its decision to overturn Roe v.
Wade—the Supreme Court majority
wrote—‘‘Women are not without elec-
toral or political power.’’ No kidding.
Clearly those bragging about over-
turning Roe v. Wade have no clue
about the power of women in America.
They found out though—when repro-
ductive freedom was on the ballot and
won—in 2022—2023—and they will find
out again—in 2024. If Americans send
me a Congress that supports the right
to choose—I promise you—I will re-
store Roe v. Wade—as the law of the
land—again!
America—cannot go back. I am here
tonight—to show the way forward. Be-
cause I know how far we’ve come. Four
years ago next week—before I came to
office—our country was hit by the
worst pandemic and the worst eco-
nomic crisis in a century. Remember
the fear. Record job losses. A record
spike in murder. A raging virus that
would take more than 1 million Amer-
ican lives and leave millions of loved
ones behind. A mental health crisis of
isolation and loneliness. A President—
my predecessor—who failed the most
basic duty any President owes the
American people—the duty to care.
That is unforgivable.
I came to office determined to get us
through one of the toughest periods in
our Nation’s history. And we have. It
doesn’t make the news—but in thou-
sands of cities and towns—the Amer-
ican people are writing the greatest
comeback story never told. So let’s tell
that story—here and now.
America’s comeback is building a fu-
ture of American possibilities—build-
ing an economy from the middle out
and the bottom up—not the top down—
investing in all of America—in all
Americans—to make sure everyone has
a fair shot and we leave no one behind!
The pandemic no longer controls our
lives. The vaccines that saved us from
COVID are now being used to help beat
cancer. Turning setback into come-
back. That’s America!
I inherited an economy that was on
the brink—now our economy is the
envy of the world! 15 million new jobs
in just 3 years—that’s a record. Unem-
ployment at 50-year lows. A record 16
million Americans are starting small
businesses and each one is an act of
hope. With historic job growth and
small business growth for Black—His-
panic—and Asian-Americans.
800,000 new manufacturing jobs in
America and counting. More people
have health insurance than ever before.
The racial wealth gap is the smallest
it’s been in 20 years. Wages keep going
up and inflation keeps coming down!
Inflation has dropped from 9 percent to
3 percent—the lowest in the world!
And now—instead of importing for-
eign products and exporting American
```

# S2274 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE March 7, 2024

jobs—we’re exporting American prod-
ucts and creating American jobs—right
here in America. Where they belong!
And the American people are beginning
to feel it.
Buy American has been the law of
the land since the 1930s. Past adminis-
trations—including my predecessor—
failed to Buy American. Not. Any.
More. On my watch—Federal projects
like helping to build American roads—
bridges—and highways will be made
with American products—built by
American workers—creating good-pay-
ing American jobs!
Thanks to my CHIPS and Science
Act—the United States is investing
more in research and development than
ever before. During the pandemic—a
shortage of semiconductor chips drove
up prices for everything—from cell
phones to automobiles. Well—instead
of having to import semiconductor
chips—which America invented I might
add—private companies are now invest-
ing billions of dollars to build new chip
factories here in America! Creating
tens of thousands of jobs—many of
them paying over $100,000 a year and
don’t require a college degree.
In fact—my policies have attracted
$650 billion of private sector invest-
ments in clean energy and advanced
manufacturing—creating tens of thou-
sands of jobs here in America!
Thanks to our Bipartisan Infrastruc-
ture Law—46,000 new projects have
been announced across your commu-
nities modernizing our roads and
bridges—ports and airports—and public
transit systems. Removing poisonous
lead pipes—so every child can drink
clean water without risk of getting
brain damage.
Providing affordable—high speed
Internet for every American—no mat-
ter where you live. Urban—suburban—
and rural communities—in red States
and blue. Record investments in tribal
communities.
Because of my investments—family
farms are better able to stay in the
family—and children and grand-
children won’t have to leave home to
make a living. It’s transformative.
A great comeback story—is
Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto
plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came
to office—the plant was on its way to
shutting down. Thousands of workers
feared for their livelihoods. Hope was
fading. Then I was elected to office and
we raised Belvidere repeatedly—with
the auto company—knowing unions
make all the difference.
The UAW worked like hell to keep
the plant open and get those jobs back.
And together—we succeeded! Instead of
an auto factory shutting down an auto
factory is re-opening—and a new state-
of-the art battery factory is being built
to power those cars. Instead of a town
being left behind—it’s a community
moving forward again! Because instead
of watching auto jobs of the future go
overseas—4,000 union workers—with
higher wages—will be building that fu-
ture—here in America!

```
Here tonight—is UAW President
Shawn Fain—a great friend and a great
labor leader. And Dawn Simms—a third
generation UAW worker in Belvidere.
Shawn—I was proud to be the first
President in American history to walk
a picket line. And today—Dawn has a
job in her hometown providing sta-
bility for her family and pride and dig-
nity. Showing once again Wall Street
didn’t build this country! The middle
class built this country! And unions
built the middle class!
When Americans get knocked down—
we get back up! We keep going! That’s
America! That’s you—the American
people! It’s because of you America is
coming back! It’s because of you our
future is brighter! And it’s because of
you—That tonight—we can proudly
say—the State of our Union is strong
and getting stronger!
Tonight—I want to talk about the fu-
ture of possibilities that we can build
together. A future where the days of
trickledown economics are over and
the wealthy and biggest corporations
no longer get all the breaks.
I grew up in a home where not a lot
trickled down on my dad’s kitchen
table. That’s why I’m determined to
turn things around so the middle class
does well—the poor have a way up and
the wealthy still does well. We all do
well. And there’s more to do to make
sure you’re feeling the benefits of all
we’re doing.
Americans pay more for prescription
drugs than anywhere else. It’s wrong
and I’m ending it. With a law I pro-
posed and signed and not one Repub-
lican voted for—we finally beat Big
Pharma!
Instead of paying $400 a month for in-
sulin—seniors with diabetes only have
to pay $35 a month! And now—I want to
cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month
for every American who needs it!
For years—people have talked about
it—but I finally got it done—and gave
Medicare the power to negotiate lower
prices for prescription drugs—just like
the VA does for our veterans. That’s
not just saving seniors money. It’s sav-
ing taxpayers money—cutting the Fed-
eral deficit by $160 billion—because
Medicare will no longer have to pay ex-
orbitant prices to Big Pharma.
This year—Medicare is negotiating
lower prices for some of the costliest
drugs on the market that treat every-
thing from heart disease to arthritis.
Now it’s time to go further and give
Medicare the power to negotiate lower
prices for 500 drugs over the next dec-
ade. That will not only save lives—it
will save taxpayers another $200 bil-
lion!
Starting next year—that same law
caps total prescription drug costs for
seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year—
even for expensive cancer drugs that
can cost $10,000—$12,000—$15,000 a year.
Now—I want to cap prescription drug
costs at $2,000 a year—for everyone!
Folks—the Affordable Care Act is
still a very big deal. Over one hundred
million of you can no longer be denied
```
```
health insurance because of pre-exist-
ing conditions. But my predecessor—
and many in this chamber—want to
take that protection away by repealing
the Affordable Care Act. I won’t let
that happen! We stopped you 50 times
before—and we will stop you again!
In fact—I am protecting it and ex-
panding it. I enacted tax credits—that
save $800 per person—per year—reduc-
ing health care premiums for millions
of working families. Those tax credits
expire next year. I want to make those
savings permanent!
Women are more than half of our
population but research on women’s
health has always been underfunded.
That’s why we’re launching the first-
ever White House Initiative on Wom-
en’s Health Research—led by Jill—who
is doing an incredible job as First
Lady. Pass my plan for $12 billion—to
transform women’s health research and
benefit millions of lives across Amer-
ica!
I know the cost of housing is so im-
portant to you. If inflation keeps com-
ing down—mortgage rates—will come
down as well. But I’m not waiting. I
want to provide an annual tax credit
that will give Americans $400 a
month—for the next 2 years—as mort-
gage rates come down—to put toward
their mortgage when they buy a first
home or trade up for a little more
space.
My Administration is also elimi-
nating title insurance fees for federally
backed mortgages. When you refinance
your home—this can save you $1,000 or
more. For millions of renters—we’re
cracking down on big landlords who
break antitrust laws by price-fixing
and driving up rents. I’ve cut red
tape—so more builders can get Federal
financing—which is already helping
build a record 1.7 million housing units
nationwide. Now pass my plan to build
and renovate 2 million affordable
homes—and bring those rents down!
To remain the strongest economy in
the world—we need the best education
system in the world. I want to give
every child a good start by providing
access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-
olds. Studies show that children who
go to pre-school are nearly 50 percent
more likely to finish high school and
go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree no
matter their background. I want to ex-
pand high-quality tutoring and sum-
mer learning time and see to it that
every child learns to read by third
grade.
I’m also connecting local businesses
and high schools so students get hands-
on experience and a path to a good-pay-
ing job whether or not they go to col-
lege. And I want to make college more
affordable. Let’s continue increasing
Pell Grants for working- and middle-
class families and increase our record
investments in HBCUs and Minority-
Serving Institutions.
I fixed student loan programs—to re-
duce the burden of student debt for
nearly 4 million Americans—including
```

# March 7, 2024 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S

nurses—firefighters—and others in pub-
lic service—like Keenan Jones—a pub-
lic-school educator in Minnesota—
who’s here with us tonight. He’s edu-
cated hundreds of students so they can
go to college—now he can help his own
daughter pay for college. Such relief is
good for the economy because folks are
now able to buy a home—start a
busines—even start a family. While
we’re at it—I want to give public
school teachers a raise!
Now—let me speak to a question of
fundamental fairness for all Ameri-
cans. I’ve been delivering real results
in a fiscally responsible way. I’ve al-
ready cut the Federal deficit by over
one trillion dollars. I signed a bipar-
tisan budget deal that will cut another
trillion dollars over the next decade.
And now—it’s my goal to cut the
Federal deficit $3 trillion more by
making big corporations and the very
wealthy finally pay their fair share.
Look—I’m a capitalist. If you want to
make a million bucks—great! Just pay
your fair share in taxes. A fair tax code
is how we invest in the things that
make a country great—health care—
education—defense—and more.
But here’s the deal. The last adminis-
tration enacted a $2 trillion tax cut
that overwhelmingly benefits the very
wealthy and the biggest corporations—
and exploded the Federal deficit. They
added more to the national debt than
in any Presidential term in American
history. For folks at home—does any-
body really think the tax code is fair?
Do you really think the wealthy and
big corporations need another $2 tril-
lion in tax breaks? I sure don’t. I’m
going to keep fighting like hell to
make it fair!
Under my plan—nobody earning less
than $400,000 will pay an additional
penny in Federal taxes. Nobody. Not
one penny. In fact—the Child Tax Cred-
it I passed during the pandemic—cut
taxes for millions of working families
and cut child poverty in half. Restore
the Child Tax Credit—because no child
should go hungry in this country!
The way to make the tax code fair is
to make big corporations and the very
wealthy finally pay their share. In
2020—55 of the biggest companies in
America made $40 billion in profits and
paid zero in Federal income taxes. Not
anymore!
Thanks to the law I wrote and
signed—big companies now have to pay
a minimum of 15 percent. But that’s
still less than working people pay in
Federal taxes.
It’s time to raise the corporate min-
imum tax to at least 21 percent so
every big corporation finally begins to
pay their fair share. I also want to end
the tax breaks for Big Pharma—Big
Oil—private jets—and massive execu-
tive pay! End it now!
There are 1,000 billionaires in Amer-
ica. You know what the average Fed-
eral tax rate for these billionaires is?
8.2 percent! That’s far less than the
vast majority of Americans pay.
No billionaire should pay a lower tax
rate than a teacher—a sanitation

```
worker—a nurse! That’s why I’ve pro-
posed a minimum tax of 25 percent for
billionaires. Just 25 percent. That
would raise $500 billion over the next 10
years.
Imagine what that could do for
America. Imagine a future with afford-
able child care—so millions of families
can get the care they need and still go
to work and help grow the economy.
Imagine a future with paid leave—be-
cause no one should have to choose be-
tween working and taking care of your-
self or a sick family member.
Imagine a future with home care and
elder care—so seniors and people living
with disabilities can stay in their
homes and family caregivers get paid
what they deserve!
Tonight—let’s all agree once again to
stand up for seniors! Many of my Re-
publican friends want to put Social Se-
curity on the chopping block. If anyone
here tries to cut Social Security or
Medicare—or raise the retirement
age—I will stop them!
Working people who built this coun-
try pay more into Social Security than
millionaires and billionaires do. It’s
not fair. We have two ways to go on So-
cial Security. Republicans will cut So-
cial Security and give more tax cuts to
the wealthy. I will protect and
strengthen Social Security—and make
the wealthy pay their fair share!
Too many corporations raise their
prices to pad their profits—charging
you more and more for less and less.
That’s why we’re cracking down on
corporations that engage in price
gouging or deceptive pricing from food
to health care to housing.
In fact—snack companies think you
won’t notice when they charge you just
as much for the same size bag—but
with fewer chips in it. Pass Senator
BOB CASEY’s bill to put a stop to
shrink-flation!
I’m also getting rid of junk fees—
those hidden fees added at the end of
your bills without your knowledge. My
Administration just announced—we’re
cutting credit card late fees from $32 to
just $8. The banks and credit card com-
panies don’t like it. Why? I’m saving
American families $20 billion a year
with all of the junk fees I’m elimi-
nating.
And I’m not stopping there. My Ad-
ministration has proposed rules to
make cable—travel—utilities—and on-
line ticket sellers tell you the total
price upfront—so there are no sur-
prises. It matters. And so does this.
In November—my team began serious
negotiations with a bipartisan group of
Senators. The result was a bipartisan
bill with the toughest set of border se-
curity reforms we’ve ever seen in this
country.
That bipartisan deal would hire 1,
more border security agents and offi-
cers. 100 more immigration judges to
help tackle a backload of 2 million
cases. 4,300 more asylum officers—and
new policies so they can resolve cases
in 6 months instead of 6 years. 100 more
high-tech drug detection machines to
```
```
significantly increase the ability to
screen and stop vehicles from smug-
gling fentanyl into America.
This bill would save lives. And bring
order to the border. It would also give
me—as President—new emergency au-
thority to temporarily shut down the
border when the number of migrants at
the border is overwhelming.
The Border Patrol Union endorsed
the bill. The Chamber of Commerce en-
dorsed the bill. I believe that given the
opportunity—a majority of the House
and Senate would endorse it as well.
But unfortunately—politics have de-
railed it so far. I’m told my predecessor
called Republicans in Congress and de-
manded they block the bill. He feels it
would be a political win for me—and a
political loser for him.
It’s not about him or me. It’d be a
winner for America! My Republican
friends—you owe it to the American
people to get this bill done. We need to
act. And if my predecessor is watch-
ing—instead of playing politics and
pressuring Members of Congress to
block this bill—join me in telling Con-
gress to pass it!
We can do it together. But here’s
what I will not do. I will not demonize
immigrants—saying they ‘‘poison the
blood of our country’’—as he said in his
own words. I will not separate families.
I will not ban people from America be-
cause of their faith.
Unlike my predecessor—on my first
day in office I introduced a comprehen-
sive plan to fix our immigration sys-
tem—secure the border—and provide a
pathway to citizenship for DREAM-
ERS—and so much more. Because—un-
like my predecessor—I know who we
are as Americans.
We are the only Nation in the world
with a heart and soul—that draws from
old and new. Home to Native Ameri-
cans whose ancestors have been here
for thousands of years. Home to people
from every place on Earth. Some came
freely. Some chained by force. Some
when famine struck—like my ancestral
family in Ireland. Some to flee persecu-
tion. Some to chase dreams that are
impossible anywhere but here in Amer-
ica.
That’s America—where we all come
from somewhere—but we are all Ameri-
cans. We can fight about the border—or
we can fix it. I’m ready to fix it. Send
me the border bill now!
A transformational moment in our
history happened 59 years ago today—
in Selma, Alabama. Hundreds of foot
soldiers for justice marched across the
Edmund Pettus Bridge—named after a
Grand Dragon of the KKK—to claim
their fundamental right to vote.
They were beaten—bloodied—and left
for dead. Our late friend and former
colleague John Lewis was at the
march. We miss him. Joining us to-
night are other marchers who were
there—including Bettie Mae Fikes—
known as the—‘‘Voice of Selma’’. A
daughter of gospel singers and preach-
ers—she sang songs of prayer and pro-
test on that Bloody Sunday to help
```

# S2276 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE March 7, 2024

shake the Nation’s conscience. Five
months later—the Voting Rights Act
was signed into law.
But 59 years later—there are forces
taking us back in time. Voter suppres-
sion. Election subversion. Unlimited
dark money. Extreme gerrymandering.
John Lewis was a great friend to
many of us here. But if you truly want
to honor him and all the heroes who
marched with him—then it’s time for
more than just talk. Pass and send me
the Freedom to Vote Act and the John
Lewis voting Rights Act!
And stop denying another core value
of America—our diversity—across
American life. Banning books. It’s
wrong! Instead of erasing history—let’s
make history!
I want to protect other fundamental
rights! Pass the Equality Act—and my
message to transgender Americans—I
have your back! Pass the PRO Act for
workers’ rights! And raise the Federal
minimum wage—because every worker
has the right to earn a decent living!
We are also making history by con-
fronting the climate crisis—not deny-
ing it. I’m taking the most significant
action on climate ever in the history of
the world.
I am cutting our carbon emissions in
half by 2030. Creating tens of thousands
of clean-energy jobs—like the IBEW
workers building and installing 500,
electric vehicle charging stations. Con-
serving 30 percent of America’s lands
and waters by 2030. Taking historic ac-
tion on environmental justice for
fence-line communities smothered by
the legacy of pollution.
And—patterned after the Peace Corps
and Ameri Corps—I’ve launched a Cli-
mate Corps to put 20,000 young people
to work at the forefront of our clean
energy future. I’ll triple that number
this decade.
All Americans deserve the freedom to
be safe. And America is safer today
than when I took office. The year be-
fore I took office—murders went up 30
percent nationwide—the biggest in-
crease in history.
That was then. Now—through my
American Rescue Plan—which every
Republican voted against—I’ve made
the largest investment in public safety
ever.
Last year—the murder rate saw the
sharpest decrease in history. And vio-
lent crime fell to one of the lowest lev-
els in more than 50 years.
But we have more to do. Help cities
and towns invest in more community
police officers—more mental health
workers—and more community vio-
lence intervention. Give communities
the tools to crack down on gun crime—
retail crime—and carjacking. Keep
building public trust—as I’ve been
doing by taking executive action on po-
lice reform and calling for it to be the
law of the land! Directing my Cabinet
to review the Federal classification of
marijuana and expunging thousands of
convictions for mere possession—be-
cause no one should be jailed just for
using or possessing marijuana!

```
To take on domestic violence—I am
ramping up Federal enforcement of the
Violence Against Women Act that I
proudly wrote—so we can finally end
the scourge of violence against women
in America!
And there’s another kind of violence
I want to stop. With us tonight is
Jazmin—whose 9-year-old sister Jackie
was murdered with 21 classmates and
teachers at her elementary school in
Uvalde, Texas.
Soon after it happened, Jill and I
went to Uvalde and spent hours with
the families. We heard their message—
and so should everyone in this cham-
ber—do something.
I did do something by establishing
the first-ever Office of Gun Violence
Prevention in the White House that
Vice President HARRIS is leading.
Meanwhile—my predecessor told the
NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns
when he was President. After another
school shooting in Iowa—he said we
should just ‘‘get over it.’’
I say we must stop it. I’m proud we
beat the NRA when I signed the most
significant gun safety law in nearly 30
years! Now we must beat the NRA
again! I’m demanding a ban on assault
weapons and high-capacity magazines!
Pass universal background checks!
None of this violates the Second
Amendment—or vilifies responsible
gun owners.
As we manage challenges at home—
we’re also managing crises abroad—in-
cluding in the Middle East. I know the
last 5 months have been gut-wrenching
for so many people—for the Israeli peo-
ple—the Palestinian people—and so
many here in America.
This crisis began on October 7th with
a massacre by the terrorist group
Hamas. 1,200 innocent people—women
and girls—men and boys—slaugh-
tered—many enduring sexual violence.
The deadliest day for the Jewish people
since the Holocaust. 250 hostages.
Here in the chamber tonight are
American families whose loved ones
are still being held by Hamas. I pledge
to all the families that we will not rest
until we bring their loved ones home.
We will also work around the clock to
bring home Evan and Paul—Americans
being unjustly detained all around the
world.
Israel has a right to go after Hamas.
Hamas could end this conflict today by
releasing the hostages—laying down
arms—and surrendering those respon-
sible for October 7th. Israel has an
added burden because Hamas hides and
operates among the civilian popu-
lation. But Israel also has a funda-
mental responsibility to protect inno-
cent civilians in Gaza.
This war has taken a greater toll on
innocent civilians than all previous
wars in Gaza combined. More than
30,000 Palestinians have been killed.
Most of whom are not Hamas. Thou-
sands and thousands are innocent
women and children. Children also or-
phaned. Nearly 2 million more Pal-
estinians under bombardment or dis-
```
```
placed. Homes destroyed—neighbor-
hoods in rubble—cities in ruin. Fami-
lies without food, water, medicine. It’s
heartbreaking.
We’ve been working non-stop to es-
tablish an immediate ceasefire that
would last for at least 6 weeks. It
would get the hostages home—ease the
intolerable humanitarian crisis—and
build toward something more enduring.
The United States has been leading
international efforts to get more hu-
manitarian assistance into Gaza. To-
night—I’m directing the United States
military to lead an emergency mission
to establish a temporary pier in the
Mediterranean—on the Gaza coast—
that can receive large ships carrying
food—water—medicine—and temporary
shelters. No U.S. boots will be on the
ground. This temporary pier would en-
able a massive increase in the amount
of humanitarian assistance getting
into Gaza every day.
But Israel must also do its part.
Israel must allow more aid into Gaza—
and ensure that humanitarian workers
aren’t caught in the cross fire. To the
leadership of Israel, I say this—human-
itarian assistance cannot be a sec-
ondary consideration or a bargaining
chip. Protecting and saving innocent
lives has to be a priority.
As we look to the future—the only
real solution is a two-state solution. I
say this as a lifelong supporter of
Israel—and the only American Presi-
dent to visit Israel in wartime.
There is no other path that guaran-
tees Israel’s security—and democracy.
There is no other path that guarantees
Palestinians can live with peace and
dignity. There is no other path that
guarantees peace between Israel and all
of its Arab neighbors—including Saudi
Arabia.
Creating stability in the Middle East
also means containing the threat posed
by Iran. That’s why I built a coalition
of more than a dozen countries to de-
fend international shipping and free-
dom of navigation in the Red Sea. I’ve
ordered strikes to degrade Houthi capa-
bilities and defend United States
Forces in the region. As Commander in
Chief—I will not hesitate, to direct fur-
ther measures to protect our people
and military personnel.
For years—all I’ve heard from my
Republican friends—and so many oth-
ers—is that China’s on the rise—and
America is falling behind. They’ve got
it backward. America is rising. We
have the best economy in the world.
Since I’ve come to office—our GDP is
up. And our trade deficit with China is
down to the lowest point in over a dec-
ade.
We’re standing against China’s unfair
economic practices. And standing up
for peace and stability across the Tai-
wan Strait. I’ve revitalized our part-
nerships and alliances in the Pacific.
I’ve made sure that the most advanced
American technologies can’t be used in
China’s weapons.
Frankly—for all his tough talk on
China—it never occurred to my prede-
cessor to do that. We want competition
```

# March 7, 2024 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE S

with China—but not conflict. And we
are in a stronger position to win the
competition for the 2lst Century
against China—or anyone else for that
matter.
Here at home—I’ve signed over 400 bi-
partisan bills. But there’s more to do
to pass my Unity Agenda. Strengthen
penalties on fentanyl trafficking. Pass
bipartisan privacy legislation to pro-
tect our children online—harness the
promise of A.I. and protect us from its
peril—ban A.I. voice impersonation—
and more!
And keep our one truly sacred obliga-
tion: To train and equip those we send
into harm’s way and care for them and
their families when they come home—
and when they don’t. That’s why I
signed the PACT Act—one of the most
significant laws ever—helping millions
of veterans who were exposed to toxins
and who now are battling more than
100 cancers. Many of them didn’t come
home. We owe them and their families.
And we owe it to ourselves to keep
supporting our new health research
agency called ARPA–H—and remind us
that we can do big things like end can-
cer as we know it!
Let me close with this. I know I may
not look like it—but I’ve been around a
while. And when you get to my age—
certain things become clearer than
ever before.
I know the American story. Again
and again—I’ve seen the contest be-
tween competing forces in the battle
for the soul of our Nation. Between
those who want to pull America back
to the past and those who want to
move America into the future.
My lifetime has taught me to em-
brace freedom and democracy. A future
based on the core values that have de-
fined America. Honesty. Decency. Dig-
nity. Equality. To respect everyone. To
give everyone a fair shot. To give hate
no safe harbor.
Now—some other people my age see a
different story. An American story of
resentment—revenge—and retribution.
That’s not me. I was born amid World
War II—when America stood for free-
dom in the world. I grew up in Scran-
ton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont,
Delaware, among working people who
built this country.
I watched in horror as two of my he-
roes—Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy—
were assassinated—and their legacies
inspired me to pursue a career in serv-
ice. A public defender—county council-
man—elected United States Senator at
29—then Vice President to our first
Black President—now President with
our first woman Vice President.
In my career—I’ve been told I’m too
young—and I’m too old. Whether young
or old—I’ve always known what en-
dures. Our North Star. The very idea of
America—that we are all created equal
and deserve to be treated equally
throughout our lives.
We’ve never fully lived up to that
idea—but we’ve never walked away
from it either. And I won’t walk away
from it now.

```
My fellow Americans—the issue fac-
ing our Nation isn’t how old we are—
it’s how old are our ideas? Hate—
anger—revenge—retribution—are
among the oldest of ideas. But you
can’t lead America with ancient ideas
that only take us back.
To lead America—the land of possi-
bilities—you need a vision for the fu-
ture of what America can and should
be. Tonight—you’ve heard mine.
I see a future where we defend democ-
racy—not diminish it. I see a future
where we restore the right to choose
and protect other freedoms—not take
them away.
I see a future where the middle class
finally has a fair shot—and the wealthy
finally have to pay their fair share in
taxes.
I see a future where we save the plan-
et from the climate crisis and our
country from gun violence.
Above all—I see a future for all
Americans! I see a country for all
Americans! And I will always be a
President for all Americans! Because I
believe in America! I believe in you—
the American people. You’re the reason
I’ve never been more optimistic about
our future!
So let’s build that future together!
Let’s remember who we are! We are the
United States of America. There is
nothing beyond our capacity when we
act together!
May God bless you all.
May God protect our troops.
