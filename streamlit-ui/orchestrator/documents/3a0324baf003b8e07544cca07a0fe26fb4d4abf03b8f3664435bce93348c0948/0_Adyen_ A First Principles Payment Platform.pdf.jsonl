And      all      of      the      first      seven      employees      at      Adyen      were      from      another      payments      processing      business      called      Bibit,      which  \n \n  Pieter      and      afew      others      started      back      in      1999  \n \n.

So      why      do      they      have      such      high      margins   \n \n?      If      you      go      back      to      the      model      and      you      start      with      their      operating      expenses   \n \n,       which      is      only      about      41%of      their      net      revenue      ,|      say      only      because      if      you      put      this      in      perspective   \n \n,      there\\\\\\'s      not   \n \na      insignificant  \n \n  amount      of      fast      growing      payments      and      software      businesses      that      will      have      operating      expenses      north      of      %100      of      revenue      to  \n \n  engender      that      revenue      growth  \n \n.      So      there\\\\\\'s      aclear      difference  \n \n.      The      largest      component      of      Adyen\\\\\\'s      OPEX      is      salaries      to      the  \n \n  employees      ,which      is      close      to      50%of      the      budget  \n \n.      The      rest      is      things      like      office      rent   \n \n,      travel      expenses      ,and      abit      on      sdles      and  \n \n  marketing  \n \n.      Now,      they      are      alarge      and      scaled      business      with      over      half      atrillion      euros      in      TPV,      and      growing      that      70%,      and      have   \n \n,      as  \n \n  |      said   \n \n,      2,200      or      so      full-time      employees  \n \n.

So      you      might      be  \n \n  thinking   \n \n,      what      is      the      catch   \n \n?      The      catch      is      that      80%of      their      growth      comes      from      their      existing      merchant      base  \n \n.      So      when      your  \n \n  growth      is      weighted      towards      the      organic      growth      of      the      underlying      merchants      ,plus      getting      more      wallet      share   \n \n,      you      don\\\\\\'t      need  \n \n  that      many      employees     .", "metadata": {"bbox": [3.84, 732.9, 576.8, 807.8], "page_idx": 4, "level": 1, "file_path": "documents/3a0324baf003b8e07544cca07a0fe26fb4d4abf03b8f3664435bce93348c0948/Adyen_ A First Principles Payment Platform.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}

The      other      reason      why      Adyen      is      so      lean      ,is      what   \n \n|      mentioned      before  \n \n.      They      built      everything      in-house      and      from      scratch  \n \n.       And      when   \n \n|      say      everything      ,|      mean      everything  \n \n.

So      their  \n \n  omnichannel      product      issuing      ,Adyen      for      Platforms  \n \n.      They      even      built      up      their      own      data      centers      around      the      world,      instead      of  \n \n  building      on      third      party      cloud      infrastructure  \n \n.      This      is      completely      different      to      the      rest      of      the      industry   \n \n,      which      buys      instead      of  \n \n  building  \n \n.
