{"page_content": "Metadata:\nThe      Massive      Scale      of      Alibaba  >\nContent:\n[00      :03      :30]      So      Alibaba      ,|      think      is      one      of      the      most      fascinating      businesses      inthe      world.\nAnd      in      America   \n \n,      we      tend      to      have  \n \n  these      simplistic      views      of      business  \n \n.      The   \n \nX      of   \n \nY      is      this.\nAnd      Alibaba      is      an      enigma      even      today      ,even      though      the      company      is      well   \n \n-       known   \n \n,      they      had      acharismatic      founder      who      gets      into      trouble      for      all      the      wrong      reasons      sometimes,      but   \n \na      brilliant      legendary  \n \n  founder  \n \n.      But      Alibaba      is      an      enigma  \n \n.      So      first      of      all,      people      say      it\\\\\\'s      Amazon  \n \n.      It      was      actually      not      Amazon  \n \n.      The      business      model   \n \n,      the  \n \n  original      business      model      is      monetized      on      advertising  \n \n.      So      it\\\\\\'s      actually      Google      in      many      ways.\nSo      even      the      assumption      that      it  \n \n  sells      e-commerce      ,yes,it      seals      e-commerce   \n \n,      but      it      monetizes      mostly      on      advertising  \n \n.      It\\\\\\'s      an      unknown      fact      inthe      industry      for the Number two.\nPeople don\\\\\\'t understand the scale of Alibaba.\nIt\\\\\\'s a bigger scale than Amazon.\nAmazon is subscale  \n \n  compared      to      Alibaba.\nSo      let      me      give      you      afew      stats      about      this.\nIn      2015   \n \n,      Alibaba      sold      $500      billion      in      volume      across      their      two  \n \n  main      e-commerce      properties      Tmall      and      Taobao  \n \n.      That\\\\\\'s      500      billion.\nIn      2020   \n \n,      they      more      than      doubled      that      to      1.2      trillion.\nAnd      in  \n \n  2025   \n \n,      by      my      estimates      ,they      will      double      again      to      2.5      trillion.\nIf      you      put      this      in      context  \n \n.      In      2015   \n \n,      they      were      10%of      total      retail  \n \n  spending      in      China.\nIn      2020   \n \n,      they      were      20%of      retail      spending   \n \na      China.\nIn      2025   \n \n,      they\\\\\\'re      25%of      retail      spending      in      China.\nSo      this      is  \n \n  a      utility      at   \n \na      scale      where      every      Chinese      consumer      that      effectively      goes      on      the      internet   \n \n,      buys      Alibaba      products      first,      and      then  \n \n  also      uses      other      stuff  \n \n.      So      if      you      take      an      analog      of      Netflix      in      the      U.S,      when      you      cut      the      cord      for      the      first      time,      or      you\\\\\\'re   \n \na      young  \n \n  student      coming      out      of      college      and      you      never      buy      acable      subscription      in      your      life,      the      first      thing      what      do      you      buy?\nYou      buy  \n \n  Netflix.\nAnd      then      you      may      layer      on      Hulu      and      you      may      layer      on      other      on-demand      services  \n \n.      But      you      start      with      Netflix      first.\nAnd  \n \n  that\\\\\\'s      Alibaba      in      China.\nIt      is      the      primary      medium      for      almost      everybody      to      satisfy      ther      human      needs      viae-commerce  \n \n.      So      that      is  \n \n  ascale      of      Alibaba.\nThis      is   \n \na      country      -scale      business     .", "metadata": {"bbox": [3.84, 451.79, 581.6, 715.86], "page_idx": 0, "level": 1, "file_path": "documents/3a0324baf003b8e07544cca07a0fe26fb4d4abf03b8f3664435bce93348c0948/Alibaba_A Giant Among Giants.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}

Then      they      needed      to      obviously      build      Alipay,      which      was      Alipay      was      the      escrow      mechanism      for      Taobao      merchants  \n \n.

Tmall      was      the      first      as      they      got      to      scale      became      abranded      business   \n \n,      where      Nike      and      Adidas      and      local  \n \n  Chinese      brands      would      create      shops      on      Tmall.\nThen      they      built      Alibaba      Cloud      in      2009      because      they      saw      how      Amazon      would  \n \n  take      that      infrastructure      and      give      it      to      the      world.\nSo,      for      the      longest      time      ,they      were      copycats  \n \n.

So      let\\\\\\'s      talk      about      that  \n \n.      Alibaba      built      Taobao      on      the      back      of      aggregating      hundreds      of      thousands      of  \n \n  millions      of      small      merchants   \n \n,      existing      and      new,      by      taking      costs      to      zero.\neBay      was      in      China      when      Alibaba      was      born,      and      eBay,      by  \n \n  the      time      decisions      got      routed      viatelegram      between      the      Bay      area      and      Bajing,it      was      game      over.\nThis      is      aso      why      Amazon      had  \n \n  to      eat      humble      pie      in      China.\nChinese      competitors      run      circles      around      American      companies     .So      American      companies      are      much  \n \n  better      off      working      with      them      than      working      against      them     .So,number      one.\nNumber      two      is      you      take      friction      to      zero.\nSo      what      did  \n \n  Pinduoduo      do?\nThey      took      prices      to      zero,      effectively      ,by      giving      very      cheap      prices      to      consumers  \n \n.      How      did      they      finance      those  \n \n  prices   \n \n?      The      hack      that      they      used      was      they      procured      directly      from      the      manufacturer      or      from   \n \na      distributor  \n \n.      So      the      key      inside      of  \n \n  Pinduoduo      is      inacountry      where   \n \n,      between      manufacturing      and      aretal      store      ,or      aretail      store      online,      there      are      multiple      levds      of  \n \n  distributors  \n \n.      Wholesalers   \n \n,      city      distributors   \n \n,      county      distributors  \n \n.      Well,      what      if      you      collapse      all      that   \n \n?      One,      you      get      your      prices      are  \n \n  much      lower.\nAnd      two,      manufacturers      just      want      to      move      large      volumes  \n \n.      So      if      you      aggregate      them      viaagamified      front      end,      like  \n \n  a      Groupon      inmany      ways,      well,      you      could      build   \n \na      business      mode      around      that.", "metadata": {"bbox": [3.84, 516.85, 577.76, 733.86], "page_idx": 5, "level": 1, "file_path": "documents/3a0324baf003b8e07544cca07a0fe26fb4d4abf03b8f3664435bce93348c0948/Alibaba_A Giant Among Giants.pdf"}, "type": "Document"}

And      in      fact   \n \n,   \n \n|      still      remember the way Pinduoduo went public ,it was inthe shadow of darkness.\nThey filed on the 4th of July,and many people the  \n \n  common      refrain      in      America      was      this      is      some      pump      and      dump      Chinese      fraud.\nIt      could      not      be      more      different      than      the      truth.\nWe,  \n \n  inthe      Western      world,      often      don\\\\\\'t      understand      the      games      and      wars      that      Chinese      companies      have      to      play      inorder      to      survive  \n \n  we      can      think      something      different  \n \n.
